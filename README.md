# logitReg: Effortless Logistic Regression Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/logitReg](https://shinyappstore.com/a/logitReg)__

logitReg, a key component of the MEPHAS suite, offers a robust user interface for performing logistic regression on diverse datasets. Logistic regression, a statistical analysis method, is used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. As part of the open-source MEPHAS platform, logitReg caters to researchers' analytical needs by enabling the calculation of descriptive statistics, plotting variables, and building simple or multiple logistic regression models. With logitReg, users gain efficient and user-friendly tools to conduct powerful statistical analyses with ease. original publication: BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 May 11;21(1):183.
